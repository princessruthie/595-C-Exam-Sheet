## VM math
- Addressable memory = address space * addressability
- Remember 1 byte = 8 bits, hex takes 4 bits
- 2<sup>10</sup> = kilo, 2<sup>20</sup> = mega, 2<sup>30</sup> = giga
- each process has its own page table that maps virtual page to physical frame
- VM/#pages = PM/#frames = page size = frame size
- Virtual address is split into log(#pages) bits and log(page_size/addressability) bits

## LL implementation
``` c 

typedef struct Node node;
struct Node {
	int data;
	node* next; //without typedef above, would need struct Node* next
};

//adding an element to the linked list at the head
//1. Create the new node
//2. Point the new node's next to the current head node
//3. Point the "head node pointer" to the new node

//function to add a node to the head follows
//have to pass in the pointer to a pointer, because we are needing to change head in a pass-by-reference fashion

int add_to_front(int value, node** head) {
	node* new = malloc(sizeof(node));
	if(new == NULL) return 1;
	new->data = value;
	new->next = *head;
	*head = new;
	return 0; //this means success, by convention
}

int contains(int val, node* h){
  node* head = h; //since h is a copy of pt'er, don't need this
  while(head != NULL){
    if(head->data == val) return 1;
    head = head->next;
  }
  return 0;
}

int fun() {
	node* h = NULL;
	add_to_front(8, &h); //the address of h is a node ptr ptr
}
```

## Generic LL
```
typedef struct Node node;
struct Node {
  void* data; //void* is a variable that holds address of "something"
  node* next;
};

int contains(void* val, node* head, int (*compare)(void*, void*)){
  while(head != NULL){
    if(compare(val, head->data) == 0) return 1;
    head = head->next;
  }
  return 0;
}

int str_compare(void* a, void* b){
  char* ac = (char*) a;
  char* bc = (char*) b;
  return strcmp(ac, bc);
}

...

node* head = ...
add_to_front...
char* name = "dog";
if(contains(name, head, &str_compare)) printf("puppy!");
```

- int (*funp) (int); //declares a pter, funp to function that takes an int (second int) and returns an int (first int)

## Array reviews
- char msg[] = "Exams are fun!";
  - can change
  - msg[0] on stack
- char* format = "%s %d";
  - cannot change. segfault
  - string literal/constant
  - format points to symbol table
- int A[] = {7, 9, 22};
  - there is no var A. A not on the stack
  - A[0] therefore is just shorthand *(&(A[0]))
  - *A = *(&(A[0])) => A = &(A[0]) = an address
  - a pt'er s a var that holds addr. Since A isn't a var, it's not a pt'er
  - A = &x //no can do. A not a var therefore cannot assign like this
- TODO. Draw the diagram of program text, heap, stack

## Structs and Data Structures
```
typedef struct Witch witch;     //makes the shortcut
typedef struct Animal animal;
struct Witch {
  char* name;
  animal* familiar;
};
struct Animal {
  char species[100];
}
```
- You can use dot `.` operator on a proper struct or `->` on a pointer to a struct
  - `witch* w = malloc(sizeof(witch));`
  - `w->familiar = a;`//a defined, initialized
  - `(*w).familiar = a;`

## Intialization
- TODO: lecture #3 material

## Threads, Locking, Trylock
- `void* threadable_fun(void* p){...}`
- `pthread t`;
- `pthread_create(&t, <config>, &threadable_fun, &param);`
  - returns 0 on success
- can omit & on &threadable
- `void* r`;
- `pthread_join(t, <pter to t's entry pt/return value>);`
  - example: pthread_join(t, &r);
  - returns 0 on success
- now recast r for usage
  - `int r_int = \*(int*)r`;
  - must cast then deref b/c you can't deref a void*
``` c
LOCKS AND TRYLOCK
//global var x
int x = 0;
//also a global var. a struct of type mutex_t named lock. 
//defined in the <pthread.h> library. the struct is global.
//not yet initialized but we will need to
pthread_mutex_t lock, lock2;

//first entry point
void* fun5 (void* p) {
	//pass our lock to a function called lock
	//attempt to aquire the lock 
	//wait here if another thread holds it (goto sleep here)
	pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
	//once lock is aquired, we can update the var x. 
	//this is our critical section (where race could occur)
	x += 8;
//once done with critical section, must unlock
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
}
//global var k
int k = 0;
void* fun6(void* p) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
	x += 4;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
}

void* fun7(void* p) {
	//we shouldn't use the same lock (lock) for this
 	//because no chance of race condition - two different global vars are being manipulated. 
// so use lock2
	pthread_mutex_lock(&lock2);
	k += 3;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock2);
}
//we need to initialize the locks before starting the threads
main() {
	//pass lock to be initialized
	//pass NULL as the config param, we can use default
	pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
	pthread_mutex_init(&lock2, NULL);
}
//returns 0 and acquires lock if available.
//returns non-zero and proceeds if not available.
pthread_mutex_trylock(&lock);
```
## fn pt'er syntax
``` c
int (*funp)(int);
/**this is declaring a pointer which is named funp to a function that takes an int as a parameter and returns an int. 
```

## Scheduling
* *Non-Preemptive*: if a process is running, it continues to run until it completes or until it gives up the CPU. So it wonâ€™t be interrupted, though it may have to wait for some resource and thereby go from 
running -> blocked -> ready -> back to running. 

* *Preemptive*: the Scheduler may interrupt after a certain amount of time and/or if some other process becomes ready.

## Gotchas
- Make sure you draw the stack going the right direction
- `if(x || b == NULL)` should be `if(a == NULL || b == NULL)`
- Using an uninitialized var is grabbing a random cup and drinking from it while hoping for a milkshake
- When dealing with hex, carefully consider RtoL or LtoR
- strcmp returns 0 if it's a match
- strncpy(to, from, max_num_non_null_characters);
